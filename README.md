# Excelsior
This is a test using [React] and the [Marvel's API].

## Getting started
First, you have to create a developer account in [developer.marvel.com]

Once you have your **Public Key**, create a ```api-key.js``` file in ```js```
dir and add a line like this:

```js
window.key = 'apikey=<your-public-key>';
```

## Running the app
To start the app use the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run watch
```

And finally open the ```index.html``` file in your browser. Have fun :ghost:
