This is a test using [React] and the [Marvel's API].

## Getting started
First, you have to create a developer account in [developer.marvel.com]

Once you have your **Public Key**, set a enviroment variable named ```API_KEY```

```bash
$ export API_KEY='your-public-key'
```

## Running the app
To start the app use the following commands:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Create the bundle.js file 
$ npm run build

# Start the server
$ npm start
```

And finally go to [localhost:3000] in your browser. Have fun :ghost:
